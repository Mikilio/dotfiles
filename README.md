# üíÅ About

This repository contains for all my NixOS and Home-manager Configurations.

Every module and package declared is exclusively intended for my
**personal use only**. While my system is stable enough to use as my daily 
driver it has some quirks, that I am well aware off. If you are trying to learn
Nix or make your own config I am happy if this repository can give you some
inspiration.

If you are interested in using parts of my config check out my
[nur-packages](https://github.com/Mikilio/nur-packages) repository.

## Cheat Sheet

Deploy home-manager config on fresh system:
```cmd
nix run github:Mikilio/dotfiles#hm switch
```
